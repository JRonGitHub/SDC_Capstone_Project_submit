Dear reader,

this is an overview of my experience with this Capstone project: 

For me it was a very interesting project: 

It was almost like more than one project: The ROS library was new to me, so was the Object Detection API part of tensorflow for the traffic light classification. I thought of the latter in respect to this project to be very intriguing as it is touching both Self-Driving Cars and Deep Learning. 

Also I am very happy for my teammates who have been both super friendly and professional at the same time :) This was a great experience to discuss our next ideas, code etc. on our teams slack channel with you/them.

My main effort to get the classifier to generalize enough to work in both environments has shown better results with the latest model (using all 3 Bosch, LARA and Udacity Simulator and testarea data).

I have tried various models and dataset arrangements. However despite this submit I am currently still working on a model, I haven't tried yet (YOLO). I further improved the dataset based on the results from the above mentioned traffic light classifier implementation.

(My teammate has used a different approach successfully for this submission: Using two classifiers instead of only one.)

(Two or so snapshots of "behind the scenes" work done can be found in the history of my other repo for this project as well: https://github.com/JRonGitHub/SDC_Capstone_Project.git)

I also developed a few preprocessing pipeline files to handle the data and to help get a dataset that helps generalizing well.
